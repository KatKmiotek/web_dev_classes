As we move into learning CSS and can style our content, we can start thinking about what we will build.  
  
Now that you know how to structure content with HTML and make it look great with CSS, it's a good time to brainstorm ideas for your own web projects. Think about what kind of website or web page you would like to create.  
It could be a personal portfolio, a family page, a recipe site, a blog, or anything that interests you.

📝 Start jotting down your ideas and consider how you 
might use both HTML for structure and CSS for styling 
as you bring your project
