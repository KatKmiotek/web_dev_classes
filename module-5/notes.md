## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a programming language that makes web pages interactive.
- It works alongside HTML (structure) and CSS (style) to add dynamic behaviour to websites (muscles).
- Examples: responding to button clicks, showing/hiding content, validating forms.

---

## How to Add JavaScript to a Web Page

- Use the `<script>` tag in your HTML.
- You can write JavaScript directly in your HTML file or link to an external `.js` file.

**Inline Example:**
```html
<script>
  alert('Hello, JavaScript!');
</script>
```

**External File Example:**
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

## Variables and Data Types

- Variables store information you want to use later.
- Declare variables with `let` or `const`.

```js
let name = "Sarah";
const age = 38;
let isLoggedIn = true;
```

- Common data types: string, number, boolean

---

## Basic Operators and Expressions

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`
- Comparison: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`, `<`

```js
let total = 5 + 3;
let isEqual = (total === 8);
```

---

## Functions

- Functions are reusable blocks of code.

```js
function greet(name) {
  alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alan");
```

---

## Events and Event Handling

- Events are actions like clicks, typing, or page load.
- You can make your website respond to events.

```html
<button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = function() {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
  };
</script>
```

---

## The Document Object Model (DOM)

- The DOM represents your web page so JavaScript can change it.
- You can select and modify elements.

```js
document.getElementById("myHeading").textContent = "New Heading!";
```

---

## Conditional Statements

- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to make decisions.

```js
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  alert("You are an adult.");
} else {
  alert("You are a minor.");
}
```

---

## Loops (Optional)

- Loops let you repeat actions.

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number: " + i);
}
```

---

## Practice Exercise

1. Add a button to your HTML page. Write JavaScript to show an alert when itâ€™s clicked.
