// Instructions:
// We are building a shop website
// List of products available in the shop is stored in products.json
// What this would be? grocery items? maybe clothing products? DIY store? You decide!
// Please update products.json file of items, provide: name, description and price, maybe add additional item.

// Now let's work on logic so in this file similar to module-5-js/examples/fetch/script.js we need to import our products (like on line 1)
// we are importing products or shop items or shop inventory so please rename change name from walks ;)


// Task 1:
// same as in example we will loop now over inventory and console log:
// "In our shop we sell: "
// and print names of all products


// Task 2:
// From our shop I want to buy each of product that is available, can you calculate how much I should pay?
// declare variable let totalPrice = 0
// loop over inventory and add price of each item to totalPrice (use +=) as in previous examples
// console log `Total money to pay for your shopping is £${totalPrice}`

// advance: what if I would like to but each product that is available in shop but 2x of 1st item?


// instruction: open Terminal -> New Terminal and type: node module-5-js/examples/fetch/practice/local/script.js
// this will execute above script and print output in terminal
