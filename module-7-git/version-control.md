# What is version control?

Version control is a system that keeps track of changes you make to files (code, notes, images). Think of it like the "save history" in a document editor but smarter: it records who changed what, when, and why â€” and lets you go back to earlier versions if needed.

Why it helps beginners:
- Recover work if something breaks (go back to a previous version).
- Keep a clear history of changes so you can explain what you changed and why.
- Share the same project with others without overwriting each other's work.

Simple everyday metaphor
- Imagine a shared notebook where every time you write a new page you also write a short note describing the change. If someone else writes on the same notebook, version control helps merge both writers' pages safely.



Why we use GitHub (the online service):
- Git is the tool that stores history on your computer. GitHub (or similar services) stores a shared copy online so classmates and teachers can download or review work.
